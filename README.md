# PyAstroDevices
Python GUI app for telescope and focuser control

This is my first Python app. It uses the ASCOM Alpyca client library package to provide control of Alpaca telescope and focuser devices. It was written and 
tested with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition with the Python Workflow installed. It uses the tkinter package to provide access to underlying U/I widgets
(controls). It has been tested on Windows 10, the only platform that I have access to, but stands a good chance of working on other supported platforms.

If you are an experienced Python developer, please be tolerant of any rookie mistakes or awkward constructs that you may find. It is my freshman journey 
into Python.

I learned enough about the Python universe to write the code, but have been unable to find a suitable tool to allow me to package and distribute the code. 
The solutions that I reviewed had drawbacks that appeared to make them be unsuitable choices.

The folder structure of the project is fairly straightforward. It includes a virtual Python environment with Python 3.10.7. The required packages a listed in
the requirements.txt file and are all PyPI installable.

If you find the bugs that are undoubtedly lurking in the code, please let me know how to re-create them and I will try to address them. If you find the app
useful in your astromony workflow I would also like to hear from you.

I hope you find it useful.
